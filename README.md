2. Create a file with a .md extension, e.g. `blog-post-1.md`
3. You can now start writing your blog. note that you MUST add these block of text at the VERY TOP of your file before adding any text.
```
---
title: 'Your Blog Title'
date: '2019-02-01'
image: 'Image Url'
---
```
4. Write the blog as usual, follow [this](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide if you need to.
5. To upload an image, upload them to the hosting of your choice first, then add the image using the following syntax :
```![image name](image-url) ```
for example, ```![sent](https://i.imgur.com/rIru4Br.png)``` will look like :
![sent](https://i.imgur.com/rIru4Br.png)
